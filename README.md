# SimpleDEX

## Project Title
**SimpleDEX: A Lightweight Decentralized Exchange on Aptos**

## Project Description
SimpleDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Aptos blockchain, allowing users to securely deposit and swap tokens without intermediaries. By leveraging the Move programming language, SimpleDEX ensures fast, transparent, and efficient peer-to-peer transactions.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a simple yet effective decentralized trading experience for Aptos users. We aim to enhance accessibility to decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering a secure and minimalistic exchange platform.

## Future Scope
- Implementing liquidity pools to facilitate automated market-making (AMM)
- Supporting additional token pairs beyond AptosCoin
- Integrating governance features for community-driven improvements
- Enhancing security measures and smart contract audits

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Token Swaps**: Users can directly swap tokens without relying on a centralized entity.
- **Secure Deposits**: Funds are safely stored on the blockchain using Aptosâ€™s robust security framework.
- **Gas-Efficient Transactions**: Optimized smart contracts ensure minimal transaction costs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support high transaction throughput with minimal latency.
